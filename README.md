# My ZMK config for Sofle

It is intended mainly for programming purposes and is designed using vim motions. Currently three layers are used:

The standard layer:
- A standard US-layout where Caps-Lock is replaced with ESC

The lower layer aka symbol layer:
- The left side is inspired by this [blog-post from sunaku](https://sunaku.github.io/moergo-glove80-keyboard.html#symbol-layer), but with slight modifications.
- The right side is inspired by [Pascal Getreuers symbol layer](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html#my-symbol-layer)
- The deviations to the above layouts are mainly driven by keeping the left shift button to utilize the symbol-layer when switching to a german layout for the 'Ã¼'. That one is directly located under the 'u'-key. Maybe I will change it in the future for optimization reasons.

The raise layer aka navigation layer:
- The left side is still the default from the original [zmk-setup](https://zmk.dev/). I am currently not actively using it, but I think it will change.
- On the right side and added hjkl as cursor keys.
- Additionally I added the 6 keys from the standard layout that are above the normal cursor keys. Thats easy to memorize.

The lower-raise layer aka settings layer:
- Is still the default from the original zmk. I am not using it currently that much.

Since this is just the beginning of my journey I am sure there will be updates.
